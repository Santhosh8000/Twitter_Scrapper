# Twitter_Scrapper
As it's name suggest, Scrapping the tweets is the only thing it does


Mining twitter data would be very helpful if you would like to build machine learning models based on NLP techniques.

I started this as an hobby project and it needs twitter developer account and it's very easy to implement.

Steps followed here:

  1. Set up Twitter development Account

  2. Import twitter package

  3. Establish connection with twitter

  4. Search by hashtags
